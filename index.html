    <h1>Color Accessibility Workflows<h1>
      <h4>by Geri Coady 4 Comments<h4>

    <p>Color is a powerful tool that allows for an almost
       infinite array of design options. Yet when applying
       color to our work, we can have a “myopic” viewpoint
       that puts us, rather than our audience, front and center.
       Author Geri Coady discusses some solid color considerations
       we can make for our audiences in this excerpt from her new book,
       Color Accessibility Workflows, available from A Book Apart.
